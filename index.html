      <p>Pig is a simple dice game first described in print in John Scarne in 1945. Players take turns to roll a single dice as many times as they wish, adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1.<br/><br/>
        Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":
      If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
      If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
      If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.<br/><br/>
      The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
