# Pig-Game

Pig is a simple dice game first described in print in John Scarne in 1945.[1] Players take turns to roll a single dice as many times as they wish, adding all roll 
results to a running total, but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1.

Pig is one of a family of dice games described by Reiner Knizia as "jeopardy dice games", where the dominant type of decision is whether or not to jeopardize previous
gains by rolling for potential greater gains.

Gameplay:
Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
